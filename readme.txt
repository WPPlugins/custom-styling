Gives you the ability to add custom CSS rules to your website's header.

== Description ==
If you want to customize the look and feel of your website but are worried that your CSS changes might get lost because of a theme or plugin update then Custom Styling has been built for you. It will give you the ability to add custom CSS rules to your website's header.

Here's why you should choose this plugin:

**Minified CSS:** It minifies the CSS rules before printing them in your site's header which keeps your webpages fast and responsive.

**Inline CSS:** According to Google's PageSpeed tool it is better to inline a small amount of CSS instead of putting it in its own file. That's why Custom Styling prints out all the rules in the head section without creating a separate file.

**Robust Code Editor:** It has a feature-rich and robust CSS editor that offers much of the same functionality as Sublime Text. This editor is powered by CodeMirror. The editor is listed under the Appearance menu of your WordPress admin area.

**Small and Light Weight:** It is extremely light-weight and doesn't put any unnecessary burden on your website.

If you like this plugin please give it a good rating.

== Installation ==
1. Use Wordpress' plugin interface to find and install the plugin.
2. Go to Appearance > Custom Styling and enter your custom CSS in the given area.
3. Hit save. Visit your website to view the changes.
